\f0\fs24 \cf0 Homework04 - Parametric Objects! \
\
My object is based on 4 input values. \
\'93makeShape\'94 is the module name with the parameters, \'93num,qual,trans,sh\'94\
\
num - how many iterations of the shape there are (in the ring)\
qual - the number of faces the shape has, the resolution of the shape\
trans - the distance between each shape\
sh - affects the reiterated shape, itself \
\
First iterations of the code was not creating a one-to-one relationship between variables and the shapes. Later iterations I figured out how to fix that. }
